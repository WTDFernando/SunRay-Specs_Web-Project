            Learning how to select frames for your prescription glasses might seem like a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be. There are a few easy ways to determine which frames would best flatter your face and show off your style and personality. <br><br>Here is how to select frames:

            Step 1: Identify your face shape
        </h2>
        <p id = "para4">
            Identifying your face shape is a good place to start when it comes to learning how to select frames. The secret to finding the perfect frames is choosing a pair that best suits your face shape. In order to find your face shape, trace your face on a mirror using a dry-erase marker. Once you know your face shape, you will know how to select your frames.
            <br>For every face shape, there are complementary frames that can help balance your look. Certain frames can accentuate or even slim certain features. If you have an oval-shaped face, good news, you will look amazing in most frames. A heart-shaped face will excel in round frames that are thicker on the top in order to balance a small chin.

            Step 2: Choose colors that complement your skin tone
        </h2>
        <p id = "para4">
            The next step in determining how to select frames is to choose colors that complement your skin tone. Finding colors that coincide with your skin tone doesn’t have to be difficult. If you have a cool-colored skin tone, opt for shades of black, gray, and blue. If your skin tone is warm, you would benefit from warm colors, such as tan, pink, and red. As always, when you learn how to select frames, it is easy to know which colors suit your skin. 
            <br>Think of the color of the clothes you feel most comfortable wearing. The same rule applies to frames for your glasses. Once you know which colors suit your skin, selecting frames can be simple. And don’t be afraid to let your personality shine through the color of your frames as well. When learning how to select frames, knowing the colors that suit your skin will help you find the perfect frames

            Step 3: Consider your way of living
        </h2>
        <p id = "para4">
            Each of us spends our days differently, which is why you must contemplate your lifestyle before making a decision on frames. If you are an athlete or if you work in a labor-intensive industry, such as construction, you’ll want to select durable frames that stay in place during daily activities. 
            <br> When considering how to select frames for your lifestyle, one of the most important things is to make sure the frames fit at the bridge of your nose. This will allow your glasses to stay put better. If you exercise often, comfortable, sturdy frames are a must. If you want to look the part at an important business meeting, you can choose stylish frames with a variety of angles. If you need sunglasses for the beach, go for soft, colorful frames that will complement your relaxed vibe.

            Step 4: Flaunt your personality
        </h2>
        <p id = "para4">
            Frames are the perfect way to show off who you are and your personality. In the process of learning how to select your frames, you cannot forget to choose those that show off your personal style. You can find the perfect shapes, colors, or patterns, but those qualities mean very little if you aren’t comfortable.
            <br> Knowing how to select frames for professional use is also important. It’s necessary to opt for frames that emphasize who you are while also remaining appropriate in the workplace. For instance, you may have a pair of colorful glasses for weekend use and then have comfortable, functional glasses for the work week. But no matter which style you choose, make sure you feel confident and are happy with your choices.
